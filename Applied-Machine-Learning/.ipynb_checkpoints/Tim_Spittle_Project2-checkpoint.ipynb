    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

      "Although there is much argument on Usenet, the general quality of argument\n",
      "found is poor.  This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\n",
      "logic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Logic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\n",
      "OED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\n",
      "it is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\n",
      "study logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\n",
      "knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\n",
      "argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\n",
      "applicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\n",
      "explains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\n",
      "the right tool for the job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Propositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\n",
      "proposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"It is\n",
      "raining\" or \"Today is Tuesday\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\n",
      "be true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\n",
      "of \"deny\", not the everyday meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\n",
      "arrangement of words used to express it.  So \"God exists\" and \"There exists a\n",
      "God\" both express the same proposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "An argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connected series of\n",
      "statements to establish a definite proposition\".  An argument consists of\n",
      "three stages.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\n",
      "continue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\n",
      "are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Premises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\",\n",
      "\"since\", \"obviously\" and so on.  (The phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with\n",
      "suspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\n",
      "premises.  If something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to\n",
      "question it.  You can always say \"Oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious\" when\n",
      "you've heard the explanation.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\n",
      "as inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\n",
      "one or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\n",
      "valid inference.\n",
      "\n",
      "The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\n",
      "inference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or\n",
      "\"therefore\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\n",
      "is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\n",
      "indicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\"\n",
      "and so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "Every event has a cause (premise)\n",
      "The universe has a beginning (premise)\n",
      "All beginnings involve an event (premise)\n",
      "This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\n",
      "Therefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\n",
      "argument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\n",
      "respect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\n",
      "the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \n",
      "afterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \n",
      "sometimes a little confusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\n",
      "conclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\n",
      "producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\n",
      "statements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\n",
      " or the Son of God.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\n",
      "the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \n",
      "conclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'll\n",
      "come to those later.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The phrase \"do your duty to God\" is not a proposition, since it is neither\n",
      "true nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\n",
      "argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \"A because\n",
      "B\".  If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\n",
      "statement is an argument.  If we're trying to establish the truth of B, then\n",
      "it is not an argument, it is an explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example:\n",
      "\n",

      "Matthew 5:17    \"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the \n",
      "prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. \n",
      "Matthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, \n",
      "not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. \n",
      "Matthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments \n",

      "There are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the\n",
      "Law was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but\n",
      "not on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human\n",
      "beings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The\n",
      "issue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do\n",
      "about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to\n",
      "impose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  It\n",
      "simply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  This\n",
      "is a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.\n",
      "(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded\n",
      "in Acts 15.)\n",
      "\n",
      "However there's more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the\n",
      "role of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent\n",
      "rejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of\n",
      "the Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a\n",
      "purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this\n",
      "issue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his\n",
      "discussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and\n",
      "assures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees\n",
      "the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their\n",
      "sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that\n",
      "has been superceded by Christ.  Paul's comments are not the world's\n",
      "clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the\n",
      "interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does\n",
      "not entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an\n",
      "uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.\n",
      "For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be\n",
      "relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we\n",

      "\n",
      "While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\n",
      "end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\n",
      "quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\n",
      "of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\n",
      "Law.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\n",
      "but in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations\n",
      "emphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\n",
      "details.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\n",
      "towards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\n",
      "5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\n",
      "discussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\n",
      "tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\n",
      "really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\n",
      "plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\n",
      "use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\n",
      "the discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\n",
      "view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\n",
      "Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\n",
      "Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\n",
      "superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\n",

      "ceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\n",
      "of conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\n",

      "In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a\n",

      "located world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment\n",
      "purposes.\n",
      "Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and\n",

      "interfacing\n",
      "and electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving\n",

      "LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:\n",
      " \n",
      "A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used\n",
      "for murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.\n",
      "The \"floor\" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions\n",
      "is hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and\n",
      "creation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and\n",
      "machine-lets.\n",
      " \n",
      " The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:\n",
      " 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;\n",
      " 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and\n",
      " 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.\n",
      " \n",
      " Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on\n",
      " it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture\n",
      " content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent\n",
      " to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.\n",
      " \n",
      "The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains\n",
      "with TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control\n",
      "electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will\n",
      "receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their\n",
      "data link to LTM1.\n",
      " \n",
      "Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a\n",
      "servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the\n",
      "SSTO\n",
      "to be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar\n",
      "landscape and land.\n",
      " \n",
      "Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped\n",
      "bulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators\n",
      "worldwide\n",
      "to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and\n",
      "takeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on\n",
      "commercially\n",
      "available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the\n",
      "interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced\n",
      "ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.\n",
      " \n",
      "By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding\n",
      "a tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be\n",
      "provided in under 80 man hours.\n",
      " \n",
      "PLAN OF ACTION:\n",
      " \n",
      "The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by\n",
      "providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network.\n",
      "Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction\n",
      "of the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be\n",
      "modified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide \"rail stock\"\n",
      "for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical\n",
      "communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.\n",
      "An initial \"ground breaking\" with miniature shovels will be performed for\n",
      "a live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial\n",
      "models will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for\n",
      "historical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely\n",
      "serious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional\n",
      "building, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and\n",
      "the photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution\n",
      "world-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will be\n",

      "their campus.\n",
      " \n",
      "A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via\n",
      "conventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment\n",
      "addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.\n",
      "Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo\n",
      "opportunity for the television community. Especially since the \"action\"\n",
      "will\n",
      "be controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be\n",
      "invited to issue \"challenges\" to engineering and human factors students at\n",
      "universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform\n",
      "lunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be\n",
      "simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.\n",
      " \n",
      "The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,\n",
      "experimentation\n",
      "and remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a\n",
      "long\n",
      "term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic\n",
      "example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited\n",

      " \n",
      "EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has\n",

      "globally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation\n",
      "purposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create\n",

      "  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\n",
      "Pahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\n",

      "  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\n",
      "khwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\n",
      "the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\n",
      "The corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\n",
      "of putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\n",
      "community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\n",
      "Parsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\n",
      "rite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\n",
      "in vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\n",
      "wax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\n",
      "of Central Asia.\n",
      "  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\n",
      "offer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\n",
      "ritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\n",
      "custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\n",
      "relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\n",
      "called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\n",
      "known for the practice of killing harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra)\n",
      "such as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\n",
      "tunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\n",
      "felt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\n",
      "and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\n",
      "breath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\n",
      "that is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\n",
      "that of the priesthood: white.\n",
      "  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\n",
      "possession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\n",
      "gradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\n",
      "professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\n",
      "inclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\n",
      "jealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\n",
      "they were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\n",
      "for teaching the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\" and thus\n",
      "the \"cult of the gods.\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\n",
      "the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\n",
      "master of himself.\n",
      "  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\n",
      "influence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\n",
      "several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\n",
      "Gaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\n",
      "Smerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\n",
      "the Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\n",
      "in Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\n",
      "as a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\n",
      "  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\n",
      "renowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\n",
      "the greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\n",
      "who arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\n",
      "Bethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\n",
      "also known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\n",
      "this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\n",
      "like \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\n",
      "Chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\n",
      "had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\n",
      "  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\n",
      "is necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\n",
      "western Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\n",
      "have been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\n",
      "Iranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\n",
      "contact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\n",
      "varying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\n",
      "  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\n",
      "varying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\n",
      "historians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\n",
      "customs, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\n",
      "belief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\n",
      "and eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\n",
      "even speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\n",
      "Magi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\n",
      "Zoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\n",
      "placed themselves under his venerable name.\n",
      "  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\n",
      "eastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\n",
      "elements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\n",
      "often, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\n",
      "Zoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjuring\n",
      "daivas\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\n",
      "texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\n",
      "practices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\n",
      "chapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\n",
      "supreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\n",
      "Gathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\n",
      "all evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\n",
      "land of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\n",
      "has been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\n",
      "absence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\n",
      "priesthood, would be very strange.\n",
      "  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\n",
      "corpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\n",
      "first millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\n",
      "directly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\n",
      "us especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\n",
      "the ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\n",
      "of the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\n",
      "spirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\n",
      "Mainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\n",
      "formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\n",
      "astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\n",
      "Mesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\n",
      "to the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\n",
      "see the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\n",
      "we give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\n",
      "  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\n",
      "important role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings, as well as in\n",
      "the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\n",
      "natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of\n",
      "Zoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began\n",
      "to study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,\n",
      "Hermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises\n",
      "on the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have\n",
      "survived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of\n",
      "wisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\n",
      "of such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an\n",
      "abundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\n",
      "  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\n",
      "ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\n",
      "_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\n",
      "most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\n",
      "second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\n",
      "the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\n",
      "to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\n",
      "  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the\n",

      "1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of\n",

      "   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\n",
      "   other users.\n",
      "\n",

      "I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\n",

      "\n",
      "First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\n",
      "Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\n",
      "exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\n",
      "completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\n",
      "or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\n",
      "this is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\n",

      "\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\n",
      "\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\n",

      "the Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.\"  Jesus lived\n",

      "away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law,\n",

      "phrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, \"accomplished\" what the \n",
      "Law was supposed to accomplish.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Verse 19:  \"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,\n",
      "and so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;\n",
      "but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the\n",
      "kingdom of heaven.\"  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish \n",
      "people about living lives under the law, this makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he \n",

      "    Artists, designers, scientists, engineers and educators share the\n",
      "    problem of moving information from one mind to another.\n",
      "    Traditionally, they have used pictures, words, demonstrations,\n",
      "    music and dance to communicate imagery.  However, expressing\n",
      "    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well\n",
      "    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far\n",
      "    exceed their technical skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression\n",
      "    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and\n",
      "    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the\n",
      "    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of\n",
      "    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar\n",
      "    representions, a confounded user asks: \"What does it all mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and\n",
      "    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by\n",
      "    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media\n",
      "    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic\n",
      "    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for\n",
      "    composing imagery for understanding.\n",

      "    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a\n",

      "\n",
      "If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\n",
      "but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\n",
      "hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Response:\n",
      "\n",
      "This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\n",
      "many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\n",
      "described as the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem.  If a person is a\n",
      "follower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\n",
      "incorrect, you have lost nothing\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in\n",
      "the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\n",
      "Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\n",
      "favour of prayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \n",
      "the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \n",
      "comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \n",
      "is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\n",
      "argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \n",
      "evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \n",
      "cost-benefit analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. One does not know whether God exists.\n",
      "  2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does\n",
      "     exist.\n",
      "  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\n",
      "  4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an\n",
      "assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in\n",
      "the abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is\n",
      "considered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no\n",
      "information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\n",
      "can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates\n",
      "information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\n",
      "no \"cost\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The\n",
      "problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\n",
      "Christian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\n",
      "argument thus collapses to \"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\n",
      "to believe in God\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\n",
      "intended the argument to be viewed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is\n",
      "omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\n",
      "a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\n",

      "\n",
      "William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's \n",

      "2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \n",

      "of non-zero complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest \n",
      "that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\n",

      "[1]  What is JPEG?\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG (pronounced \"jay-peg\") is a standardized image compression mechanism.\n",
      "JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the\n",
      "committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either\n",
      "full-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\n",
      "It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\n",
      "drawings.\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\n",
      "handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\n",
      "of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\n",
      "respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't\n",
      "quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\n",
      "of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\n",
      "the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details\n",
      "of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\n",
      "be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\n",
      "small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\n",
      "invisible to the eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\n",
      "adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\n",
      "off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\n",
      "files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\n",
      "archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\n",
      "aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\n",
      "can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "[2]  Why use JPEG?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n",
      "24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\n",
      "networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n",
      "2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\n",
      "disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\n",
      "size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n",
      "\n",
      "If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to\n",
      "convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\n",
      "with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\n",
      "than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\n",
      "JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\n",
      "store or transmit an image more cheaply.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\n",
      "time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\n",
      "extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\n",
      "posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\n",
      "(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\n",
      "only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\n",
      "to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\n",
      "black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\n",
      "in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\n",
      "people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\n",
      "more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\n",
      "GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\n",
      "things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\n",
      "gray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\n",
      "similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display\n",
      "hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\n",
      "\n",
      "GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\n",
      "such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\n",
      "that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\n",
      "by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\n",
      "introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\n",
      "(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\n",
      "should be avoided in JPEG files.)\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\n",
      "adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\n",
      "come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\n",
      "sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\n",
      "often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\n",
      "particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.\n",
      "If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\n",
      "scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\n",
      "subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\n",
      "The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\n",
      "\n",
      "Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\n",
      "You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\n",
      "images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\n",
      "of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\n",
      "should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\n",
      "(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\n",
      "applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\n",
      "a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\n",
      "can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\n",
      "converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.\n",
      "If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\n",

      "may not.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is atheism?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\n",
      "Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\n",
      "often referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong\n",
      "atheism\".\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \"Weak\n",
      "atheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\n",
      "atheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\n",
      "fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\n",
      "atheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\n",
      "flat-out denials.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\n",
      "it to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\n",
      "believing that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\n",
      "not.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is agnosticism then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\n",
      "Metaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\n",
      "disclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\n",
      "must be some cause unknown and unknowable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\n",
      "sure whether God exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\n",
      "you can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact\n",
      "that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\n",
      "use agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" only when\n",
      "referring to \"strong atheism\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Beware also that because the word \"atheist\" has so many shades of meaning, it\n",
      "is very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\n",
      "sure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn't\n",
      "the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\n",
      "about the universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\n",
      "particular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\n",
      "is essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\n",
      "such a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\n",
      "see no evidence that God exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\n",
      "quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\n",
      "all other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\n",
      "obeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\n",
      "well-defined is a matter for debate.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\n",
      "impossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\n",
      "God.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to\n",
      "show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.\n",
      "\n",
      "If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in\n",
      "question is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid\n",
      "may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing\n",
      "might be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search is\n",
      "often impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest\n",
      "primes, because we can prove that they don't exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist\n",
      "unless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of\n",
      "the time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusively\n",
      "prove that no unicorns exist anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be\n",
      "tested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\n",
      "prove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by\n",
      "default that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God\n",
      "exists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover\n",
      "varieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it\n",
      "may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be\n",
      "possible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious\n",
      "book does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described\n",
      "by any present-day religion exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very\n",
      "close to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different\n",
      "that counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of\n",
      "God are not really applicable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction\n",
      "must be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be\n",
      "detectable.\n",
      "\n",
      "If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\n",
      "does not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue\n",
      "that if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no\n",
      "importance whether he exists or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.\n",
      "Surely he should still be detectable today?\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically\n",
      "verifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some\n",
      "effect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\n",
      "from all the other things that don't exist?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but\n",
      " isn't it still a religious belief?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \"the\n",
      "redefinition game\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Person A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out\n",
      "that it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the\n",
      "statement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He\n",
      "then records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to\n",
      "it, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \"agreed fact\", but\n",
      "uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure\n",
      "redefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\n",
      "to be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\n",
      "\n",
      "The point of this digression is that the answer to the question \"Isn't\n",
      "atheism a religious belief?\" depends crucially upon what is meant by\n",
      "\"religious\".  \"Religion\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman\n",
      "controlling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and\n",
      "worship.\n",

      "\n",
      "Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it\n",
      "categorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of\n",
      "\"religious\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of\n",
      "human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \"religious\" as well -- such as\n",
      "science, politics, and watching TV.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is\n",
      " still just an act of faith, like religion is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one\n",
      "actually believes in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to\n",
      "make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists\n",
      "try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to\n",
      "questioning if experience throws them into doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally\n",
      "assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are\n",
      "the sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called\n",
      "\"acts of faith\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on\n",
      "acts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.\n",
      "According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of\n",
      "faith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as\n",

      "The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\n",
      "The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\n",
      "(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\n",
      "coefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\n",
      "(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\n",
      "algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\n",
      "difference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\n",
      "algorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\n",
      "use a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\n",
      "dominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\n",
      "the dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\n",
      "\n",
      "Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\n",
      "+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\n",
      "over this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\n",
      "is thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\n",
      "expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\n",
      "somewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\n",
      "by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\n",
      "constant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\n",
      "lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\n",
      "to hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\n",

That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
